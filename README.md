# KeePassXC DB Syncing Tool

> Do you have KeePassXC on multiple devices?
> Don't you wish their was a easy way to sync all the database's together?
> This tool aims to solve that problem!

## PLAN
- run server on one machine, client on other
- client send db to server
- server then merges the two db's
- server sends back the merged db
- client removes old db and replaces with new one
